Jeff Passan joins the show to examine Gehrig's legacy, and to share the story of the man who actually made MLB's Lou Gehrig Day happen: Brian Wayne Gallantine.

    "text": "MLB spring training is upon us! After a long offseason of big trades and bigger contracts being signed, baseball has finally returned. The defending World Series champion Dodgers bolstered their already deep rotation by signing Cy Young winner Trevor Bauer, but the biggest threat to their potential dynasty might be 122 miles down the 5 Freeway. The Padres locked up Fernando Tatis for the next 14 years in addition to adding Yu Darvish, Joe Musgrove, and Blake Snell to their pitching rotation. In the American League, the Yankees are poised to finally get over the hump...if they can stay healthy. Jeff Passan joins us to break down everything we need to know about spring training. Then, Pablo reflects on Naomi Osaka's speaking against violence toward Asian-Americans."
