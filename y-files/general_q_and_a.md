+ Anyone know how to get ESlint to run in all of my directories? I did the npm install —save-dev eslint and npx eslint —init then configured the eslintrc.json in my root but all I have are the warnings that come with the VSCode ESlint extension. The rules I set up in that eslintrc.json only work in my top-most directory, not my react-app.

+ I encountered a situation where Flask-Migrate wasn't updating my tables. I had to go in and manually set the type of one of the erroring table columns to resolve the issue. This occurred after I had un-seeded, migrated, and upgraded several times for my project. The error would consistently show the wrong data type for one of the columns I had just updated.
