<meta name="description" content="The Power of the Dog (/title/tt10293406/) | In Theaters and Premieres on Netflix on Wednesday, Dec. 1

Plot: A ruthless rancher torments his brother and his new wife and son until he finds himself exposed to the possibility of love.

Our Take: I'm eager to watch Benedict Cumberbatch (/name/nm1212722) play against type in this Western drama, not to mention his always great co-stars Jesse Plemons (/name/nm0687146) and Kirsten Dunst (/name/nm0000379). Oscar-winning director Jane Campion (/name/nm0001005) returns to the director's chair 12 years after her previous feature, and it's all but certain we'll be talking about this film again come Oscar season.&mdash; James"/>
